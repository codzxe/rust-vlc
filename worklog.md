- Inspected environment; found uploaded design package "VLC Redesign (Community) (1).zip" (105 SVG exports, ~77 MB: Player variants incl. Light/Music/hide-UI/customize, 14 Settings screens, Onboarding, Keyboard Shortcuts, network stream, playlists, context menus, EQ/Spatializer/Compressor/Stereo Widener, Video Colors/Crop/Essential/HDR, Components, Miniplayer, Icon).
- Unpacked design exports to design/figma/ (102 files on disk).
- git init on main; wrote .gitignore, README.md, AGENTS.md (agent protocol), this worklog.
- Writing docs/MASTER-PROMPT.md (verbatim authoritative brief) next.
- Wave 1 plan: Wave A (01-architecture, 02-phase0-audit-plan, 03-engine-plan, 04-codec-format-roadmap, 05-command-layer), Wave B (06-plugin-architecture, 07-config-driven-system, 08-ui-figma-fidelity, 09-web-wasm-target, 10-testing-ci-quality), Wave C (11-dependency-security-compliance, 12-performance-benchmarking, 13-agent-wave-program, 14-risk-register, 15-git-workflow), then docs/ROADMAP.md consolidation.

Stage Summary:
- Repo + governance scaffolding in place; design package pinned as visual source of truth.
- Decisions: working name "Lumen" (rebrandable via product.toml); design assets committed to repo (license check tracked as risk); Lead commits during planning waves.
